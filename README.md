- 👋 Hi, I’m @MJKMars
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D modeling, animation, CG, computer security, sciences, and engineering, electrical and mechanical engineering, architecture, and art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, how to code in C(++ and #), Python, JS, SQL, 3D world building, creature creation, and modeling, as well as neural networks and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything from video game development, to short film, to database building, and security systems (hash verifications, salts, peppers, firewalls)
- 📫 How to reach me either through a direct message here on git hub or through my email mjkmars@gmail.com. Please only reach out to me in regards to a project I either have made or you want my help on.
